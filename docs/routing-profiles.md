## How Tiers Work

ClawRouter automatically classifies your query into one of four tiers:

- **SIMPLE**: Basic questions, short responses, simple lookups
- **MEDIUM**: Code generation, moderate complexity tasks
- **COMPLEX**: Large context, multi-step reasoning, complex code
- **REASONING**: Logic puzzles, math, chain-of-thought tasks

The router picks the cheapest model capable of handling your query's tier.
